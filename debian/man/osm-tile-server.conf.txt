NAME
  osm-tile-server.conf - Configuration for automatic setup of OSM tile server 

DESCRIPTION
  The osm-tile-server configuration file, /etc/osm-tile-server.conf, is used to configure how the automatic setup of an OSM tile server will be done. The default values are suitable for small imports on computers with limited memory resources. If you want to import an entire planet file, some changes should be done unless you want to wait forever.

  DBNAME=       
    Sets the postgres database name for the OpenStreetMap data

  IMPORT_SLIM=  
    true or false

    Sets import mode to --slim if true.

  IMPORT_MEMORY=  Sets how many MBs of memory will be used during the import. (The "-C" argument for osm2pgsql)

  IMPORT_CACHE_STRATEGY=  
    optimized, dense, sparse, chunked

    Sets the cache strategy to use. (The "--cache-strategy %s" argument for osm2pgsql). See osm2pgsql(1) for details.

  IMPORT_PROCESSES=       
    Selects how many CPU cores to use while importing.

  SRC_URL=    
    URL for downloading OSM data for regions. The default is "http://download.geofabrik.de"
